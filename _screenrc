# .screenrc startup file for GNU Screen
#
# note,
#   screen -x <identifier>
# will attatch you to a screen without detaching other clients, creating a
# multi-user session.  You can detach a single client from this session like
# you normally would with '^a d'.  However, if you ran 'screen -x ...' *from*
# another screen, the '^a d' will detach your *original* screen.  You can pass
# escaped commands on to deeper levels of screens with '^a a', which sends an
# '^a' to the process running inside your top level screen.  So '^a a d' will
# detach you from the multi-user screen running inside your base screen :p.
#
# there is a nice introduction by Chris Lumens, at
#   http://www.bangmoney.org/presentations/screen.html
