This package provides automatic synchronization of assorted dotfiles,
simplifying the maintnance of a uniform configuration across several
hosts.

The basic implentation was by Steve Kemp at
  http://dotfiles.repository.steve.org.uk

To install it, simple replace your ~/.bashrc file with mine (or at
least replace the portions dealing with ~.dotfiles).  Whenever you
open a bash shell, that code will check for the existence of a
~/.dotfiles directory, and if necessary, download it from my public
repository (ideally using git, but it falls back on wgetting a
tarball).  It then creates simlinks to any dotfiles that you had been
missing automatically.

After installation, the code in your .bashrc file will check for
weekly updates at the central server.  Any updates to the files that
it controls (i.e. dotfiles symlinked into ~/.dotfiles/_XXX) will be
applied automatically.

In order to increase your local installation's similarity with the
central server, take a look at the differences between your installed
dotfiles and those in ~/.dotfile with
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  make localdiff | less
If you see a few places where you like your local version better, make
a patch, and save the hunks in (see *making local.patch* below)
  ~/.dotfiles/local.patch
You can do a dry run of any update with
  cd ~/.dotfiles && ./fixup.sh --dry-run
or overide with
  cd ~/.dotfiles && ./fixup.sh --dry-run --force
Then put .dotfiles in control with
  make override
which will replace all your local dotfiles with their .dotfiles version
and then patch them as you specified in local.patch.


Making local.patch

Set up your installed dotfiles as you want them to be.  (TODO: helper
script for partial, interactive merges of the central version.)  Then
just
    make localpatch
